{"id":"09ir77fu","parent_id":null,"name":"Create theme system","description":"Create a theme system that can be configured by the user","priority":1,"completed":true,"result":"Implemented strict config-file theme infrastructure with three commits. Added layered AppConfig loading (defaults < file < env), strict TOML deserialization with unknown-key rejection, strongly typed theme enums, and fail-fast startup errors for invalid config path/content. Added theme resolver module with built-in presets (default, light, high-contrast), token-based style lookup, and deterministic preset+override merging. Rewired REPL rendering to use ThemeToken mapping while preserving existing color enablement precedence. Added README configuration docs for file path, schema, tokens, modifiers, and precedence.\n\nVerification:\n- cargo fmt --all\n- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings\n- cargo test -- --nocapture (90 unit tests + 1 e2e passed)\n\nCommits:\n- 678198c feat(config): add strict file-based app config\n- 24c2e8b feat(cli): add preset and token-based theme resolver\n- 7a4b107 docs(config): document theme file and token schema","metadata":null,"created_at":"2026-02-20T14:10:16.365Z","updated_at":"2026-02-20T14:53:47.660Z","started_at":"2026-02-20T14:53:47.658Z","completed_at":"2026-02-20T14:53:47.660Z","blockedBy":[],"blocks":[],"children":[]}
